# mdm-removal-script-V2

### New Features
* The script has been condensed into a single file, simplifying its usage.
* A user interface is currently in development and will be released eventually.

### Device Support?
Honestly i am not sure. I did my testing on an iPhone 8 running 14.7.1. I would love to hear how you go with it. 
I would like to look at a different option to checkra1n.

### How to Use It
To use the script, follow these steps:

1. Install checkra1n from the <a href=https://checkra.in>checkra1n</a> website.
2. Clone the repo or download it as a `.zip` file.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the downloaded folder.
4. Execute the following command: `chmod +x ./MDM-Remove-Host.sh`
5. Run the script: `./MDM-Remove-Host.sh`
6. Follow the prompts provided by checkra1n to jailbreak your device.
7. Press Enter in the terminal when checkra1n is complete.
8. Your device will reboot, and you will be prompted to set up your device as usual. Proceed with the setup process, and you should no longer encounter MDM restrictions.
